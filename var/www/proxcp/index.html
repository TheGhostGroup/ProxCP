	<h1>SaaS is meant to be different</h1>
	<br><br><br>
	<h2>SaaS should give you unlimited access to software. What should be paid is only support & updates. You guys dont get that, try to make me pay forever, with lousy support that has less Linux skills than me, and shit documentation. So I'll just refuse to pay and give people the option to use this decent software for free.</h2>
	<br><br>
	<h2>This took me far too long, not gonna lie, but it had to be done. I figured out both the daemon and dashboard license checks, envato checks etc. and added them all to this server. To everyone wanting to use this, simply go <a href="https://github.com/marcus-alicia/proxcp" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the instructions!</h2>
